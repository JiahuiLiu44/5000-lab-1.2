# Introduction

-The **Impromptu BibTeX Find and Merge Tool**, developed by MJ Marchywka, 
is a Bash script designed to scrape BibTeX entries from arbitrary web 
pages. 
-This tool simplifies the process of gathering citations by 
automating the detection of BibTeX entries for citation management [@marchywka2021impromptu].

>"A tool that simplifies BibTeX citation management can significantly 
enhance research efficiency." â€” Anonymous Researcher

## Features of the Tool
Here are the primary charactrstics of the **Impromptu BibTeX Find and 
Merge Tool**:

- **Automatic Detection**: The tool automatically finds BibTeX citations 
on webpages.
- **Customizable Scraping**: Users can modify the scraping parameters to 
suit their needs.

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Manual BibTeX Entry**: Finding and copying is time-consuming.

**Automated BibTeX Entry**: The tool automates BibTeX citation retrieval 
and merging.

## Tool Workflow

The following table outlines the typical workflow of the **Impromptu 
BibTeX Find and Merge Tool**:

| Step              | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Web Scraping   | Automatically detects BibTeX citations on pages. |
| 2. Data Extraction| Extracts relevant BibTeX data.                   |
| 3. Data Merging   | Merges BibTeX entries into a single file.        |
| 4. Final Output   | Outputs a consolidated BibTeX file.              |

## Importance of BibTeX Automation

The time saved can be quantified using an optimization formula for time efficiency:

$$
T_{\text{manual}} - T_{\text{automated}} = \Delta T_{\text{saved}}
$$
Where:
- $T_{\text{manual}}$ is the time taken to manually collect citations.
- $T_{\text{automated}}$ is the time taken using the automated tool.
- $\Delta T_{\text{saved}}$ is the net time saved.
